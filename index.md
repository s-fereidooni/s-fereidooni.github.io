Welcome! I am an undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. Currently, I am a member of [Dr. Rose Yuâ€™s](https://roseyu.com/) Spatiotemporal Machine Learning Lab where I am involved in research related to Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically in the implementation of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and related algorithms. My primary research interest is in Machine Learning and its applications to complex decision-making problems.

### Here is an unordered list:

- Item foo
- Item bar
- Item baz
- Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
