Welcome! I am an undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. Currently, I am a member of [Dr. Rose Yuâ€™s](https://roseyu.com/) Spatiotemporal Machine Learning Lab, where I am involved in research related to Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning for biomedical applications. My primary research interest is in Machine Learning and its applications to complex decision-making problems, particularly in healthcare.
